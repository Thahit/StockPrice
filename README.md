# Maintext/StockPredictionMultipleInputs
Just for me to learn tools. Trying to predict stock market ("Open")values (MS) with data from yahoo. The data I for prediction is the opening value, closing value... of the past 60 days. Using a LSTM-NN for doing the predictions.
- Maintext takes the data from a single stock to predict future values
- StockPredictionMultipleInputs Uses Apple and HP data in combination with MS data to predict the price of MS
