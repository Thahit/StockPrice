# BuyOrSell
Testing Stock analysis methods I find, to see if they work. But they are simble and are not expected to have great results. It is more of a programming exercice / getting experience working with stock data and getting to know technical indicators. <br> Per Efficient Market Hypothesis it is not possible to generate value with these kinds of analysis, and studies show that most markets atleast have the weak market efficiency, atleast after adding transaktion costs(Financial Economics (BOEC0212)).

Methods:
- 1. using SMA(short moving average) https://www.dummies.com/personal-finance/investing/stocks-trading/how-to-interpret-and-use-moving-averages-in-trading/
- 2. Zero crosses https://www.ig.com/en-ch/trading-strategies/macd-trading-strategy-190610#:~:text=The%20strategy%20is%20to%20buy,the%20signals%20issued%20too%20late.
- 3. MACD crosses signal Line Algorithmic Trading & Quantitative Analysis Using Python(Udemi course)(https://www.udemy.com/course/algorithmic-trading-quantitative-analysis-using-python/learn/lecture/14650722#content)

I decided to sepperate the methods, as one big Notebook(BuyOrSell) is not very userfriendly. It will not get updated if changed will be made to the methods/new methods are added.

Unfortunately, You cannot see the interactive Bokeh visualisations within github, you will have to run the code yourself to see the results(the interactive Plots).
