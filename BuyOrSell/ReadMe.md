# BuyOrSell
Testing Stock analysis methods I find, to see if they work. But they are simble and are not expected to have great results. It is more of a programming exercice / getting experience working with stock data and getting to know technical indicators. <br> 
According to the efficient market hypothesis, it is not possible to generate value with this type of analysis, and studies show that most markets have at least weak market efficiency, at least after transaction costs are added. My experiments are no prove to that theory, but show, that it is atleast not very easy

Methods:
- 1. using SMA(short moving average) https://www.dummies.com/personal-finance/investing/stocks-trading/how-to-interpret-and-use-moving-averages-in-trading/
- 2. Zero crosses https://www.ig.com/en-ch/trading-strategies/macd-trading-strategy-190610#:~:text=The%20strategy%20is%20to%20buy,the%20signals%20issued%20too%20late.
- 3. MACD crosses signal Line Algorithmic Trading & Quantitative Analysis Using Python(Udemi course)(https://www.udemy.com/course/algorithmic-trading-quantitative-analysis-using-python/learn/lecture/14650722#content)

I decided to sepperate the methods, as one big Notebook(BuyOrSell) is not very userfriendly. It will not get updated if changed will be made to the methods/new methods are added.

Unfortunately, You cannot see the interactive Bokeh visualisations within github, you will have to run the code yourself to see the results(the interactive Plots).
