# BuyOrSell
Testing Stock analysis methods I find, to see if they work. But they are simble and are not expected to have great results. It is more of a programming exercice / getting experience, working with stock data and getting to know technical indicators. <br>
I decided to sepperate the methods, as one big Notebook(BuyOrSell) is not very userfriendly. It will not get updated if changed will be made to the methods/new methods are added.
Methods:
- using SMA(short moving average) https://www.dummies.com/personal-finance/investing/stocks-trading/how-to-interpret-and-use-moving-averages-in-trading/
- Zero crosses https://www.ig.com/en-ch/trading-strategies/macd-trading-strategy-190610#:~:text=The%20strategy%20is%20to%20buy,the%20signals%20issued%20too%20late.

Unfortunately, You cannot see the interactive Bokeh visualisations within github, you will have to run the code yourself to see the results(the interactive Plots).
